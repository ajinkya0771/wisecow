# 🐮 Wisecow – Kubernetes Deployment with CI/CD & TLS  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is a **self-developed implementation** based on the open-source *Wisecow* web application, enhanced to meet all requirements of the **AccuKnox DevOps Trainee Practical Assessment**.  
It demonstrates **containerization, orchestration, CI/CD automation**, and **secure TLS communication** using **Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions**.

---

## 🏁 Completion Note  
This project fulfills all objectives of the **AccuKnox DevOps Trainee Assessment**, including:  
- Docker-based containerization  
- Kubernetes deployment  
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions  
- TLS encryption  
- Bash-based monitoring scripts  

Sensitive TLS certificate files were **securely removed and added to `.gitignore`** to maintain **DevSecOps compliance**, ensuring functionality with secure best practices.  

✅ *All deliverables implemented, tested, and verified successfully.*
